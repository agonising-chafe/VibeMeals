# VibeMeals – Persona Pain Checklists (Regression Guide)

**Purpose:** Use these as **regression tests** for any new feature or flow. Scan the relevant checklist(s) to ensure you're not reintroducing pains we've designed to eliminate.

## Checklist 1: Ashley – Full-Time Working Mom, Logistics Overload

**Her world:** commute, 2 kids, sports nights, she's the default dinner owner.

#### Check: does this feature…

- [ ] Make weekly planning feel like a **project** again (multiple apps, long sessions, lots of decisions)?

- [ ] Assume she has **time or energy at 5 pm** to pick recipes, debug lists, or reorganize the week?

- [ ] Increase the **number of decisions** she has to make on weeknights (vs compressing them into a small weekly check-in)?

- [ ] Make a successful week depend on her **maintaining a pantry**, tagging things, or doing admin?

- [ ] Risk **missing critical ingredients** if she skips optional steps (Quick Review, pantry setup, etc.)?

- [ ] Hide thaw/marinate/soak in fine print so she only discovers it **the night of**?

- [ ] Punish her for chaos (skipped meals, changed plans) with **guilt, scolding copy, or lots of cleanup work**?

- [ ] Increase **food waste guilt** by encouraging her to buy ingredients with no realistic plan to use them?

- [ ] Suggest complex meals on nights that are likely **already brutal** (sports, late meetings) without any safety net?

- [ ] Frame failures as **her** fault ("you forgot," "you didn't log," "you didn't plan well") instead of normalizing chaos?

## Checklist 2: Brianna – Budget-Stretched Single Mom

**Her world:** part-time + freelance, 2 kids, money is tight; time AND cash are scarce.

#### Check: does this feature…

- [ ] Encourage her to buy more **expensive ingredients or premium items** without being clear about the cost impact?

- [ ] Make saving money depend on **fiddly work** (detailed budgeting screens, tagging every item, manual price entry)?

- [ ] Increase the risk of **wasting paid-for ingredients** because plans are too rigid or unrealistic for her life?

- [ ] Assume she can comfortably absorb **overbuying** (e.g., multiple extra packs "just in case")?

- [ ] Treat cost as an afterthought instead of a **primary constraint** (e.g., beautiful plans that quietly get expensive)?

- [ ] Require her to do a bunch of **coupon / sale / deal research** inside the app to get value?

- [ ] Make her feel like a failure if she sometimes chooses **cheaper, less "perfect" meals** or pantry scrambles?

- [ ] Assume she can always do **one big perfect shop** instead of sometimes needing smaller, staggered trips?

## Checklist 3: Kayla – Planning for One (Cook vs Delivery)

**Her world:** lives alone, hybrid work, volatile evenings, DoorDash is always right there.

#### Check: does this feature…

- [ ] Assume a **7-dinner grid** or "full coverage week" as the default goal for her?

- [ ] Punish her for **planning uncertainty** (social plans, dates, gym nights) by making it hard to move / skip meals?

- [ ] Push recipes that create **too many leftovers** (4+ servings) with no support for boredom or repurposing?

- [ ] Make her feel like she's "failing" when she **orders delivery** instead of cooking?

- [ ] Require too much **commitment up front** ("lock in all your dinners this week") when her reality is fluid?

- [ ] Increase her **leftover guilt**: more unloved containers, more half-used ingredients, no clear next step?

- [ ] Treat "cooking for one" as just "family cooking, but smaller," ignoring **loneliness + clean-up overhead**?

- [ ] Make the cooking path feel **more work** than opening a delivery app, especially on low-energy nights?

## Checklist 4: Danielle – Stay-at-Home but Overscheduled

**Her world:** 3 kids, PTA, carpool, sports, managing the household; everyone assumes she has time.

#### Check: does this feature…

- [ ] Add more **admin burden** (tagging, organizing, maintaining data) instead of reducing it?

- [ ] Assume she has long **uninterrupted cooking windows** when her days are chopped into 15-minute blocks?

- [ ] Make **parallelization harder** (coordinating mains + sides, managing multiple burners/timers)?

- [ ] Ignore **partner/kid veto risk** by not making rerolls cheap and safe?

- [ ] Increase **leftover chaos** (mystery containers, no clear plan for using them)?

- [ ] Make her feel like the **sole owner** of dinner success/failure without shared visibility?

- [ ] Push "crafty" or complex organization (boards, tags, collections) when she needs dead-simple flows?

## Checklist 5: Jake & Maya – DINK, Urban Professionals (Bonus Contrast)

**Their world:** two adults, long work days, social life, workouts; not kid-tethered.

#### Check: does this feature…

- [ ] Assume they're **home every night** and want a plan for all 7 days?

- [ ] Make it awkward to handle **last-minute cancellations** ("we're going out instead") without waste or friction?

- [ ] Overcomplicate things for nights where they just want a **fast, decent meal for two**?

- [ ] Force them into "family-style" behavior (big roasts, kid-friendliness) that doesn't fit their reality?

- [ ] Make them feel guilty for **not cooking often enough**, instead of supporting 2–3 solid cook nights?

- [ ] Lack a clear, easy way to say "we're eating out tonight" without "breaking" the plan?

---

## Checklist 6: Ellen & Mark – Empty Nesters / Deep Habits (Bonus Contrast)

**Their world:** just the two of them, semi-retired or stable routines, strong food habits.

#### Check: does this feature…

- [ ] Overwhelm them with **variety and novelty** when they mostly want gentle twists on their rotation?

- [ ] Assume **family-sized portions** and drive unwanted leftovers they can't finish?

- [ ] Make the week feel over-structured when they only want **3–4 dinners planned**, not 7?

- [ ] Ignore **health shifts** (lighter meals, less rich food, less late-night eating) and push heavy options by default?

- [ ] Make small adjustments (scaling down, repeating favorites) feel **harder than they are today**?

- [ ] Depend on lots of **tech fiddling** or multi-step flows they're unlikely to enjoy?

## How to Use These Checklists

For any feature, ask:

- **"Are we re-introducing any of Ashley's pains?"**  
  Ashley's checklist is the **primary gate** (she's your bullseye).

- Then: **"Does this make life worse for Brianna / Kayla / Danielle / Jake & Maya / Ellen & Mark?"**  
  The others are contrast tests:

- **Kayla:** planning-for-one + delivery competition

- **Brianna:** budget stress

- **Danielle:** interrupted time + emotional load

- **Jake & Maya:** volatility + low kid-chaos

- **Ellen & Mark:** small plans + grooves

If any checklist box gets checked, either redesign or consciously accept that trade-off.
