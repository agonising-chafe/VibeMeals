# Linting Note

`docs/vision.md` is intentionally excluded from Markdownlint checks.  
It is a LOCKED specification (v4.6.0) with deliberate repeated headings (for example: "Given", "When", "Design/Eng Notes") and punctuation that produces stable, human-readable fragments. Changing it for lint compliance would violate the lock.
