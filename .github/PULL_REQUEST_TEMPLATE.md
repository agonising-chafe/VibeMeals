## Checklist

Before requesting review, I have:

- [ ] Run unit tests locally:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- [ ] Run pragmatic markdown lint (if docs changed):

  ```bash
  npm run lint:md
  ```

- [ ] (If I touched data-model or domain types) Verified types are in sync:

  ```bash
  npm run validate:types
  ```

- [ ] (If I edited docs heavily) Optionally normalized docs:

  ```bash
  # optional but recommended for big doc edits
  pwsh scripts/normalize-docs-md.ps1
  ```
