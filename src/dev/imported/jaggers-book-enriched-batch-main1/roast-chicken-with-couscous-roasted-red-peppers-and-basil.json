Using kitchen shears, thoroughly trim excess fat and skin from cavity. Lift 1 drumstick and use paring knife to cut 1/2-inch slit in skin where drumstick and thigh meet. Turn chicken on side so breast faces edge of counter. Cut 1/2-inch slit in skin where top of thigh meets breast. Repeat both cuts on opposite side of chicken. Tuck wingtips behind back. Sprinkle about one-third of salt mixture into cavity. Brush top and sides of chicken with melted butter. Sprinkle remaining salt mixture evenly over all sides of chicken."
