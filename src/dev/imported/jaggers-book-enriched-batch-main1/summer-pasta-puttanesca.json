        "displayName": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORK When we make pasta puttanesca with fresh tomatoes, we want the tomatoes to share equal billing with the pungently flavorful olives and anchovies typical of this robust sauce. For a puttanesca that would make the most of fresh tomatoes, we opted to use grape or cherry tomatoes, which are both excellent in summer and among the best varieties of tomatoes available year-round. To retain the fresh tomato flavor, we pureed the tomatoes and strained the juices, which we cooked down briefly to thicken the sauce. We added the tomato pulp back in at the end of cooking so we wouldn’t lose the fresh tomato flavor. We traded the traditional long pasta for frilly campanelle, which held on to the coarse sauce and gave our dish a summery flair. We prefer to make this dish with campanelle, but fusilli and orecchiette also work. Very finely mashed anchovy fillets (rinsed and dried before mashing) can be used instead of anchovy paste. Buy a good-quality black olive, such as kalamata, Gaeta, or Alfonso.",
