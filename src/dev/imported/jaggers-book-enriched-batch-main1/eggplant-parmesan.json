Repeat with remaining eggplant and kosher salt, placing second batch on top of first. Let stand until eggplant releases about 2 tablespoons liquid, 30 to 45 minutes. Spread eggplant slices on triple thickness of paper towels; cover with another triple thickness of paper towels. Press firmly on each slice to remove as much liquid as possible, then wipe off excess salt."

Process bread in food processor to fine, even crumbs, about 20 to 30 seconds. Transfer crumbs to shallow dish and stir in Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and salt; set aside. Wipe out workbowl (do not wash) and set aside."

Place 8 to 10 eggplant slices in bag with flour; seal bag and shake to coat slices. Remove slices, shaking off excess flour, dip into eggs, let excess egg run off, then coat evenly with bread-crumb mixture; set breaded slices on wire rack set over baking sheet. Repeat with remaining eggplant."

Place half of breaded eggplant slices on each sheet in single layer; bake until eggplant is well browned and crisp, about 30 minutes, switching and rotating baking sheets after 10 minutes, and flipping eggplant slices with wide spatula after 20 minutes. Do not turn off oven."

Heat olive oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes in large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and garlic is light golden, about 3 minutes; stir in processed tomatoes and remaining can of diced tomatoes. Bring sauce to boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and reduced, about 15 minutes (you should have about 4 cups). Stir in basil and season with table salt and pepper to taste."

Layer in half eggplant slices, overlapping slices to fit; distribute 1 cup more sauce over eggplant; sprinkle with half of mozzarella. Layer in remaining eggplant and dot with 1 cup more sauce, leaving majority of eggplant exposed so it will remain crisp; sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining mozzarella. Bake until bubbling and cheese is browned, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes, scatter basil over top, and serve, passing remaining tomato sauce separately."
