Using tongs, stand each piece on its side and cook, turning pieces as necessary, until sides are well browned and internal temperature registers 140 to 145 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer pork to platter, tent loosely with foil, and let rest until temperature registers 150 degrees on instant-read thermometer, while making pan sauce. Serve with sauce."
