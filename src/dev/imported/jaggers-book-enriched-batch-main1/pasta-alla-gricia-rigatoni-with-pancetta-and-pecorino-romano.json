Using slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to bowl; set aside. Pour fat from pot into liquid measuring cup (you should have 1/4 to 1/3 cup fat; discard any extra). Return fat to Dutch oven."

Boil mixture rapidly, scraping up any browned bits, until emulsified and reduced to 11/2 cups, about 5 minutes. (If you’ve reduced it too far, add more reserved cooking water to equal 11/2 cups.)"

Off heat, adjust sauce consistency with remaining reserved cooking water as needed. Transfer pasta to platter and serve immediately, passing extra pepper and Pecorino separately."
