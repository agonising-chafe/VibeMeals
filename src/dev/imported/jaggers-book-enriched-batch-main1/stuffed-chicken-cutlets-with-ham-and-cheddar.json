        "stepNumber": 3,
        "instruction": "Butterfly each chicken breast and pound between two sheets of plastic wrap to a uniform 1/4-inch thickness. Pound the outer perimeter to 1/8 inch. Place the chicken cutlets, smooth side down, on a work surface and season with salt and pepper. Spread each cutlet with one-quarter of the cheese mixture, then place 1 slice of ham on top of the cheese, folding the ham as necessary to fit onto the surface of the cutlet. Roll up each cutlet from the tapered end, folding in the edges to form a neat cylinder. Refrigerate until the filling is firm, at least 1 hour."
      },
      {
        "stepNumber": 4,
        "instruction": "FOR THE CHICKEN: Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 450 degrees. Set a large wire rack over a large baking sheet and set aside. Place the flour in a pie plate or shallow dish. Beat the eggs with 1 tablespoon of the oil in a second plate. Spread the bread crumbs in a third plate. Dredge 1 chicken roll in the flour, shaking off the excess, then coat with the egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip off. Coat all sides of the chicken roll with the bread crumbs, pressing gently so that the crumbs adhere. Place on the wire rack and repeat the flouring and breading with the remaining chicken. Allow the coating to dry for about 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Wipe the wire rack and baking sheet clean and set aside."

        "stepNumber": 5,

Using tongs, carefully add the chicken, seam side down, to the pan, and cook until medium golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn each roll and cook until medium golden brown on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer the chicken rolls, seam side down, to the now-clean wire rack on the baking sheet; bake until deep golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a roll registers 160 degrees, about 15 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing each roll crosswise on the diagonal with a serrated knife into five pieces; arrange on individual dinner plates and serve. (Cutlets can be filled and rolled in advance, wrapped in plastic wrap, then refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)"
