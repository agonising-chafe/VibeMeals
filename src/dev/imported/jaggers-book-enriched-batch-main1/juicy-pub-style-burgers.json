Spread meat over sheet and inspect carefully, discarding any long strands of gristle or large chunks of hard meat or fat."

Divide meat into 4 lightly packed balls. Gently flatten into patties 3/4 inch thick and about 41/2 inches in diameter.

Using spatula, transfer burgers to skillet and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Using spatula, flip burgers over and cook 2 minutes longer.
