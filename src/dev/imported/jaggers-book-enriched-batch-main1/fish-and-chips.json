        "instruction": "Place cut fries in large microwave-safe bowl, toss with 1/4 cup oil, and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave on high power until potatoes are partially translucent and pliable but still offer some resistance when pierced with tip of paring knife, 6 to 8 minutes, tossing them with rubber spatula halfway through cooking time. Carefully pull back plastic wrap from side farthest from you and drain potatoes into large mesh strainer set over sink. Rinse well under cold running water. Spread potatoes on few clean dish towels and pat dry. Let rest until fries have reached room temperature, at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour."

        "stepNumber": 2,
        "instruction": "While fries cool, whisk flour, cornstarch, salt, cayenne, paprika, and pepper in large bowl; transfer 3/4 cup of mixture to rimmed baking sheet. Add baking powder to bowl and whisk to combine."
      },
      {
        "stepNumber": 3,
        "instruction": "In large Dutch oven heat 2 quarts oil over medium heat to 350 degrees. Add fries to hot oil and increase heat to high. Fry, stirring with a mesh spider or slotted metal spoon, until potatoes turn light golden and just begin to brown at corners, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer fries to thick paper bag or paper towels to drain."

        "stepNumber": 4,
        "instruction": "Reduce heat to medium-high, add remaining 1 quart oil, and heat oil to 375 degrees. Meanwhile, thoroughly dry fish with paper towels and dredge each piece in flour mixture on sheet; transfer pieces to wire rack, shaking off any excess flour. Add 11/4 cups beer to flour mixture in bowl and stir until mixture is just combined (batter will be lumpy). Add remaining 1/4 cup beer as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking after each addition, until batter falls from whisk in thin, steady stream and leaves faint trail across surface of batter. Using tongs, dip 1 piece fish in batter and let excess run off, shaking gently. Place battered fish back on sheet with flour mixture and turn to coat both sides. Repeat with remaining fish, keeping pieces in single layer on sheet."

Fry, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer fish to thick paper bag or paper towels to drain. Allow oil to return to 375 degrees."
