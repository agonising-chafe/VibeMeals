        "displayName": "WHY THIS RECIPES WORKS The best falafel are moist, tender, packed with vibrant fresh herbs and aromatics, and sturdy enough to form and fry. We started by soaking dried chickpeas overnight to soften them slightly and then ground them into coarse bits along with onion, herbs, garlic, and spices. Though many recipes call for mixing starch (flour, cornstarch, or chickpea flour) into the dough, we found success using a technique associated with Asian bread baking called tangzhong, a cooked flour paste. This paste added moisture without making the batter too fragile to form and fry. Adding a bit of baking powder to the dough helped to lighten the fritters as they fried. Frying the fritters at 325 degrees allowed the moist interiors to fully cook through just as the exteriors turned brown and crisp. This recipe requires that the chickpeas be soaked for at least 8 hours. Use a Dutch oven that holds 6 quarts or more. An equal amount of chickpea flour can be substituted for the all-purpose flour; if using, increase the amount of water to 1/2 cup in step 4. Do not substitute canned beans or quick-soaked chickpeas. They will make stodgy falafel. Serve the falafel with the tahini sauce as an appetizer or in pita bread with lettuce, chopped tomatoes, chopped cucumbers, fresh cilantro, and pickled turnips. Serve the first batch of falafel immediately or hold them in a 200-degree oven while the second batch cooks.",
