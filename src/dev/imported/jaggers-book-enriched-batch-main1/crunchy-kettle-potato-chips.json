While oil heats, slice potatoes crosswise 1/16 inch (11/2 millimeters) thick. Carefully add all potatoes to oil, 1 small handful at a time, separating slices as much as possible (oil will bubble vigorously). Cook, stirring constantly with wooden spoon, until bubbling has calmed (it will not completely stop) and slices begin to stiffen, 2 to 4 minutes."

Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer chips to prepared rack. Sprinkle with salt or, if using topping, let chips cool for 30 seconds, then transfer chips to large bowl with topping and toss until evenly coated. Serve. (Chips can be stored in zipper-lock bag at room temperature for up to 5 days.)"
