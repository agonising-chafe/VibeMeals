        "displayName": "Taiwanese braised eggs (“lu” means “braised,” and “dan” means “egg”) are eggs cooked or marinated in a soy sauce broth. They are eaten as an appetizer or as a side dish alongside proteins such as zha paigu. If you don’t have a steamer basket, use a spoon or tongs to gently place the eggs in the water. It does not matter if the eggs are above the water or partially submerged. You can use this method for fewer eggs without altering the timing. You can also double this recipe as long as you use a pot and steamer basket large enough to hold the eggs in a single layer. We developed this recipe with michiu, Taiwanese rice wine; if it’s unavailable, clear rice wine and sake make good substitutes. The soy marinade can be reused to marinate up to three batches of eggs; it can be refrigerated for up to one week or frozen for up to one month.",
