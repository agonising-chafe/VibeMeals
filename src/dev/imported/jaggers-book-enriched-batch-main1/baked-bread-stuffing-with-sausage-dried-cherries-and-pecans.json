Bake until the edges have dried but the centers are slightly moist (the cubes should yield to pressure), 45 to 60 minutes, stirring several times during baking. Transfer the dried bread to a large bowl and increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees. (Bread can be stored in an airtight container for up to 1 day ahead.)"

Add the wings in a single layer and cook until golden brown on both sides, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer the wings to a separate bowl and set aside."

Add the onion, celery, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir in the thyme, sage, and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in 1 cup of the broth, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to a simmer. Add the vegetable mixture to the bowl with the dried bread and toss to combine."

Add the egg mixture, cherries, pecans, and sausage to the bread mixture and toss to combine; transfer to the prepared baking dish. Arrange the wings on top of the stuffing, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and place the baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet."

To finish, remove the wings from the stuffing and re-cover the stuffing tightly with foil. Heat on a rimmed baking sheet in a 375-degree oven until hot, 20 to 25 minutes.
