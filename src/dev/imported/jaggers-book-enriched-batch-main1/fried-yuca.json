Cut remaining yuca crosswise into 3-inch lengths. Place pieces cut side down and use knife to remove skin in sections, cutting away any flesh that isn’t pure white. Halve yuca pieces lengthwise. Pop out any woody core with spoon. Place each piece cut side down and cut lengthwise into 3/4-inch-thick wedges."

While yuca is cooking, place wire cooling rack in rimmed baking sheet. Drain yuca well in colander. Spread on wire rack. (Boiled yuca can be cooled on rack, wrapped in plastic wrap, and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before frying.) Rinse Dutch oven and dry very well."
