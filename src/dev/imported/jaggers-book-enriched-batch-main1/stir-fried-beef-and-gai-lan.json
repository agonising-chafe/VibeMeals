Remove leaves, small stems, and florets from stalks; slice leaves crosswise into 11/2-inch strips (any florets and stems can go into pile with leaves); and cut stalks on bias into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Set aside. When beef is firm, stand 1 piece on its side and slice against grain 1/4 inch thick. Repeat with remaining pieces. Transfer to bowl. Add 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch and toss until beef is evenly coated. Set aside."
