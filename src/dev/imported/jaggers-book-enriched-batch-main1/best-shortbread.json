Pulse the oats in a spice grinder or blender until reduced to a fine powder, about ten 5-second pulses (you should have 1/4 to 1/3 cup oat flour). In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the oat flour, all-purpose flour, cornstarch, sugar, and salt on low speed until combined, about 5 seconds. Add the butter to the dry ingredients and continue to mix on low speed until the dough just forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, 5 to 10 minutes."
      },
      {
        "stepNumber": 2,
        "instruction": "Place a 9- or 91/2-inch springform pan on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet (do not use the springform pan bottom). Press the dough into the collar in an even 1/2-inch-thick layer, smoothing the top of the dough with the back of a spoon. Place a 2-inch biscuit cutter in the center of the dough and cut out the center. Place the extracted round alongside the springform collar on the baking sheet and replace the cutter in the center of the dough. Open the springform collar, but leave it in place."
      },
      {
        "stepNumber": 3,
        "instruction": "Bake the shortbread for 5 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 250 degrees. Continue to bake until the edges turn pale golden, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Remove the baking sheet from the oven; turn off the oven. Remove the springform pan collar; use a chef’s knife to score the surface of the shortbread into 16 even wedges, cutting halfway through the shortbread. Using a wooden skewer, poke 8 to 10 holes in each wedge. Return the shortbread to the oven and prop the door open with the handle of a wooden spoon, leaving a 1-inch gap at the top. Allow the shortbread to dry in the turned-off oven until pale golden in the center (the shortbread should be firm but giving to the touch), about 1 hour."
