        "instruction": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Pull roast apart at its major seams (delineated by lines of fat) into 2 halves. Use knife as necessary. With knife, remove large knobs of fat from each piece, leaving thin layer of fat on meat. Tie 3 pieces of kitchen twine around each piece of meat. Thoroughly pat beef dry with paper towels; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place pancetta in large Dutch oven; cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to paper towel–lined plate and reserve. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat; set Dutch oven over medium-high heat and heat fat until just smoking. Add beef to pot and cook until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes total. Transfer beef to large plate; set aside."

        "instruction": "Reduce heat to medium; add onions, carrots, celery, and tomato paste to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften and brown, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, flour, sugar, and reserved pancetta; cook, stirring constantly, until combined and fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add wine and tomatoes, scraping up any browned bits; add thyme sprig, rosemary, and parsley. Return roast and any accumulated juice to pot; increase heat to high and bring liquid to boil, then place large sheet of aluminum foil over pot and cover tightly with lid. Set pot in oven and cook, using tongs to turn beef every 45 minutes, until dinner fork easily slips in and out of meat, about 3 hours."

Add minced thyme, bring liquid to boil over high heat, and cook, whisking vigorously to help vegetables break down, until mixture is thickened and reduced to about 31/2 cups, about 18 minutes. Strain liquid through large fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids with spatula to extract as much liquid as possible; you should have 11/2 cups strained sauce (if necessary, return strained sauce to Dutch oven and reduce to 11/2 cups). Discard solids in strainer. Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste."
