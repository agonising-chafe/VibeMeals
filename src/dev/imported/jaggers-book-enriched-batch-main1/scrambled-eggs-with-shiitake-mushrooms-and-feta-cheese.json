Oyster or cremini mushrooms can be substituted for the shiitake mushrooms, if desired; to prepare the oyster or cremini mushrooms, trim the stems but do not remove them. Precrumbled feta is often coated with cellulose to keep it from caking. For the best results, buy a block of feta and crumble it yourself.",
