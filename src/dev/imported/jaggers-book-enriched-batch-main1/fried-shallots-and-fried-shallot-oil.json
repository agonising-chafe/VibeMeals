        "displayName": "Crispy fried shallots are one of our all-time favorite garnishes. Once you get used to having them on hand, they start to infiltrate your cooking in many delicious ways—try them in sandwiches, on salads, and on top of pureed soups, just to start. But this recipe is for Fried Shallot Oil as much as it is for Fried Shallots. Most oil used for home frying is destined for the trash, but this golden oil is infused with rich fried shallot flavor and is great in stir-fries and curries or as a garnish for soups and stews. If the shallots are not sliced to a consistent thickness, they will cook and brown unevenly. We tested slicing the shallots by hand and using the disk blade on a food processor, but only a mandoline provided the consistent thickness required for this recipe. It is crucial to strain the shallots from the oil while they are still deep golden—not brown—to prevent them from turning bitter. Finishing the shallots in a low oven removes their excess moisture without the risk of overbrowning. This recipe can be halved and cooked in a small saucepan.",

Continue to cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until few shallots turn golden, 8 to 11 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low so that oil is bubbling gently, and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are deep golden, 2 to 4 minutes."

        "instruction": "Immediately strain oil into prepared bowl. Quickly spread shallots onto prepared sheet and sprinkle evenly with salt; stir shallots to incorporate salt and blot oil on paper towel. Slide shallots off paper towel directly onto sheet; discard paper towel. Bake until shallots are dry and firm to touch, 15 to 25 minutes. Let shallots and oil cool completely and store separately in airtight containers. (Shallots can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 month; shallot oil can be stored in refrigerator for up to 1 month.)"
