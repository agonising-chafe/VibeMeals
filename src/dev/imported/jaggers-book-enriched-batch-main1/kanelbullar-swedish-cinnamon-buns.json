Fit mixer with dough hook and mix on low speed until all flour is moistened, 1 to 2 minutes (dough will look quite dry). Let stand for 15 minutes. Add sugar and salt and mix on medium-low speed for 5 minutes. Stop mixer and add butter and cardamom. Continue to mix on medium-low speed 5 minutes longer, scraping down dough hook and sides of bowl halfway through mixing (dough may stick to bottom of bowl but should clear sides)."

Roll dough into 18 by 10-inch rectangle, with shorter side parallel to edge of counter. Using offset spatula, spread filling over lower two-thirds of rectangle, going all the way to edges (if filling is too stiff to spread, transfer to smaller bowl and microwave for 5 to 10 seconds). Fold upper third of dough over middle third. Fold lower third over middle third to create 10 by 6-inch rectangle. Roll into 12-inch square."

        "stepNumber": 6,
        "instruction": "Cut dough into twelve 1-inch strips. Cut each strip in half lengthwise, leaving it attached at very top (each strip will look like a pair of legs). Extend 1 strip to 24-inch length, but do not stretch. Starting at 1 end, wrap strip around tips of your first 3 fingers, loosely coiling strands side by side along length of your fingers. Continue to wrap loosely until you have just 4 to 6 inches left. Use your thumb to pin dough to side of bundle closest to you, then loop remaining strip over bundle. Transfer to prepared sheet, tucking end of strip under bun. Repeat with remaining strips. Cover sheet with plastic or damp dish towel. Let sit until slightly puffed, about 1 hour."

Brush buns with egg mixture (you won’t need all of it) and sprinkle 1 teaspoon pearl sugar on top of each bun. Bake until buns are golden brown and register at least 200 degrees, 13 to 17 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Transfer buns, still on sheet, to wire rack and let sit for 5 minutes. Use spatula to transfer buns to wire rack (some filling may leak out and form crisp frill around bun). Let cool for at least 10 minutes before serving. (Buns can be cooled completely and stored in a zipper-lock bag at room temperature for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 weeks.)"
