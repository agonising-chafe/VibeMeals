Gently nestle the potatoes in the salt, broad side down, leaving space between each potato. Add the rosemary sprigs and the garlic, cut side up, to the baking dish. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and crimp the edges to tightly seal. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes; remove the pan from the oven. Increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees."

Return the uncovered baking dish to the oven and continue to bake until the potatoes are tender and the skins are glossy, 15 to 20 minutes."

Using a fork, mash the garlic, butter, minced rosemary, and remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt to a smooth paste. Remove any clumped salt from the potatoes (holding the potatoes with a kitchen mitt if necessary), split lengthwise, top with a portion of the butter and serve immediately."
