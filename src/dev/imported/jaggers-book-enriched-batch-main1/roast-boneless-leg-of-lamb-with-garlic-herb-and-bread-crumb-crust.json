Process 1 teaspoon oil, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and garlic in now-empty processor until minced, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, about 1 minute. Transfer 11/2 tablespoons herb mixture to bowl and reserve. Scrape remaining mixture into bowl of bread crumbs; stir in Parmesan and 1 tablespoon oil and set aside."

Spread reserved herb mixture evenly over lamb, leaving 1-inch border around edge. Roll roast and tie with kitchen twine at 11/2-inch intervals.

Brown roast well on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to prepared rack and roast until lamb registers 105 to 110 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer roast to carving board; remove twine. Brush roast exterior with mustard, then carefully press bread crumb mixture onto top and sides of roast with your hands, pressing firmly to form solid, even coating that adheres to roast. Return coated roast to prepared rack; roast until lamb registers 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 10 to 15 minutes longer. Transfer roast to carving board and let rest for 20 minutes. Slice roast into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Serve."
