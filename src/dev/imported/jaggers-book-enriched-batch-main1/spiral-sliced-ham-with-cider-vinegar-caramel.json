Tie bag shut and place ham cut side down on prepared wire rack. Bake until center registers 110 degrees, 31/2 to 41/2 hours."

While sugar mixture cooks, microwave vinegar in bowl until steaming, about 90 seconds; set aside. Once sugar mixture is straw-colored, reduce heat to low and continue to cook, swirling saucepan occasionally, until mixture is dark amber–colored and just smoking and registers 360 to 370 degrees, 2 to 5 minutes longer. Off heat, add warm vinegar a little at a time, whisking after each addition (some caramel may harden but will melt as sauce continues to cook). When bubbling subsides, add pepper and five-spice powder. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 11/3 cups, 5 to 7 minutes."

Transfer sheet to oven and cook until glaze is bubbling and starting to brown in places, 5 to 7 minutes. Add reserved juices to remaining 1 cup caramel and whisk to combine."
