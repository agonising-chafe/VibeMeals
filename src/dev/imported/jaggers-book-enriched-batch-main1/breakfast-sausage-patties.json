Using your hands or stiff rubber spatula, knead pork vigorously, smearing against sides and bottom of bowl, until pork begins to tighten, feels tacky, and sticks to bottom of bowl and palm of your hand, 11/2 to 2 minutes. Use immediately or wrap bowl tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hours (or transfer sausage to zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 1 month)."

Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook half of patties until well browned on both sides and meat registers 145 to 150 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to serving platter and tent with aluminum foil. Repeat with remaining patties. Serve. (Raw sausage patties can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 24 hours or frozen for up to 1 month. Cook frozen patties for 7 to 9 minutes per side.)"
