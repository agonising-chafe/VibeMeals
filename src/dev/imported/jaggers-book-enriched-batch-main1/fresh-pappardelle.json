        "displayName": "Use this tender, easy-to-roll dough for strand pasta. Six egg yolks, in addition to two whole eggs and a couple tablespoons of olive oil, make the dough incredibly supple while also adding great flavor. The addition of olive oil is a debated topic in Italy, but we find that it makes the dough easier to roll while still keeping it springy and delicate. You can roll this dough with a manual pasta machine or by hand. Resting the dough for at least 30 minutes before rolling allows the gluten—the protein network that forms when flour and liquid interact and that makes doughs chewy—time to relax and minimizes contraction. If using a high-protein all-purpose flour, such as King Arthur, increase the number of egg yolks to seven.",
