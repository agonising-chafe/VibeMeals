Add onion and continue to cook until onion is soft and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon and onion to bowl, leaving fat in skillet (you should have about 1 teaspoon)."

        "instruction": "Add 2 tablespoons butter to bacon fat and melt over medium heat. Add potatoes and 1/2 teaspoon salt and stir to coat potatoes evenly with fat. Cover and cook, shaking pan occasionally, for 9 minutes. After 9 minutes, potatoes should be bubbling at edges; if there is no moisture around potatoes, lower heat slightly; if there is no or little sizzling around potatoes, increase heat slightly. Cover and continue to cook until potatoes can be easily pierced with tip of paring knife, 6 to 9 minutes."

Continue to cook, uncovered, gently stirring every 2 to 3 minutes until potatoes are golden brown (not all surfaces will be brown), about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk eggs in bowl and add pepper and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt; set aside."

Pour eggs over potatoes and cook, without stirring, until eggs begin to set, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Using rubber spatula, lift edge of cooked egg, then tilt pan to 1 side, so uncooked egg runs underneath. Repeat process, working around pan edge, using spatula to gently scrape uncooked egg toward rim of skillet, until top is just slightly wet, 11/2 to 2 minutes."
