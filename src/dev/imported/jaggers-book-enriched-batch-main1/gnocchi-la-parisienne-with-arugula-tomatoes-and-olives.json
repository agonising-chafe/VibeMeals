As soon as mixture boils, remove saucepan from heat and stir in flour until incorporated. Return saucepan to low heat and cook, stirring constantly, using smearing motion, until mixture looks like shiny, wet sand, about 2 minutes."

With processor running, gradually add eggs in steady stream. When all eggs have been added, scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula. Continue to process until smooth, thick, sticky paste forms, about 30 seconds longer."

Using 1 hand, hold pastry bag at 45-degree angle so tip is about 3 inches away from surface of water and squeeze bag to force dough out of tip. Using paring knife, cut off 3/4-inch lengths and let them fall into water. Continue to pipe until 20 to 30 gnocchi are in pot. Simmer until gnocchi float and are slightly firm, about 2 minutes. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to prepared sheet. Repeat until all dough is cooked (4 to 6 batches). (If not proceeding immediately, allow gnocchi to cool completely. Transfer to airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Alternatively, freeze on sheet until solid, then transfer to zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 2 months; sauté from frozen, adding 1 to 2 minutes to sautéing time.)"

Add tomatoes, olives, thyme, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, tossing occasionally, until tomatoes start to soften, about 2 minutes. Add lemon juice and gnocchi to skillet and gently stir until gnocchi are evenly glazed. Off heat, add arugula and stir until it just starts to wilt, about 15 seconds. Top with chives and serve immediately, passing Parmesan separately."
