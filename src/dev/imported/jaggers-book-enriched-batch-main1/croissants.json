Whisk in yeast; transfer the milk mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the flour, sugar, and 2 teaspoons salt. Using the mixer’s dough hook, knead on low speed until a cohesive dough forms, 2 to 3 minutes. Increase the speed to medium-low and knead for 1 minute. Remove the bowl from the mixer, remove the dough hook, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes."

        "stepNumber": 3,
        "instruction": "To make the butter block: While the dough chills, fold a 24-inch length of parchment in half to create a 12-inch rectangle. Fold over 3 open sides of the rectangle to form an 8-inch square with enclosed sides. Crease the folds firmly. Place the cold butter directly on the work surface and beat with a rolling pin for about 60 seconds until the butter is just pliable, but not warm, folding the butter in on itself using a bench scraper. Beat into a rough 6-inch square. Unfold the parchment envelope. Using the bench scraper, transfer the butter to the center of the parchment square, re-folding at the creases to enclose. Turn the packet over so that the flaps are underneath and gently roll the butter packet until the butter fills the parchment square, taking care to achieve an even thickness. Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes."

After 30 minutes, transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll into a 17 by 8-inch rectangle with the long side of the rectangle parallel to the edge of the work surface. Unwrap the butter and place it in the center of the dough so that the butter and dough are flush at the top and bottom. Fold 2 sides of the dough over the butter square so they meet in the center. Press the seam together. With the rolling pin, press firmly on each open end of the packet. Roll out the dough, perpendicular to the edge of the work surface, until it is 24 inches long and 8 inches wide. Bring the bottom third of the dough up, then fold the upper third over it, folding like a business letter into an 8-inch square. Turn the dough 90 degrees counterclockwise. Roll out the dough again, perpendicular to the edge of the work surface, into a 24 by 8-inch rectangle and fold into thirds. Place the dough on the baking sheet, wrap tightly with plastic wrap, and return to the freezer for 30 minutes."

After 30 minutes, transfer to a lightly floured work surface and roll into an 18 by 16-inch rectangle with the long side of the rectangle parallel to the edge of the work surface. Fold the upper half of the dough over the lower half. Using a ruler, mark the dough at 3-inch intervals along the bottom edge with a bench scraper (you should have 5 marks). Move the ruler to the top of the dough, measure in 11/2 inches from the left, then use this mark to measure out 3-inch intervals (you should have 6 marks). Starting at the lower left corner, use a pizza wheel or knife to cut the dough into triangles from mark to mark. You will have 12 single triangles and 5 double triangles; discard any scraps. Unfold the double triangles and cut into 10 single triangles (making 22 equal-size triangles in total). If the dough begins to soften, return to the freezer for 10 minutes."

Cut a 1/2-inch slit in the center of the short end of the triangle. Grasp the triangle by 2 corners on either side of the slit and stretch gently, then grasp the bottom point and stretch. Fold both sides of the slit down. Positioning your palms on the folds, roll partway toward the point. Gently stretch the point again; continue to roll, tucking the point underneath. Curve the ends gently toward one another to create a crescent shape. Repeat with the remaining triangles."

In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, water, and a pinch of salt. Brush the croissants with the egg wash using a pastry brush. Place the croissants in the oven and reduce the temperature to 400 degrees. Bake for 12 minutes then switch and rotate the baking sheets. Continue to bake until deep golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes longer. Transfer the croissants to a wire rack and allow to cool until just warm, about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."
