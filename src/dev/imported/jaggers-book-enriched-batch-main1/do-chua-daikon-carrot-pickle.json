        "displayName": "Do chua is a Vietnamese quick pickled carrot and daikon condiment that is served as an accompaniment to bánh xèo crepes, summer rolls, or bún cha. To crisp the shredded carrots and daikon, we let them sit with a small amount of salt and sugar and then rinsed and drained them. Then we added them to a tangy-sweet mixture of white vinegar, salt, and sugar. This pickle is quite pungent. Cover it tightly before storing it in the refrigerator. The aroma will dissipate soon after the pickle is uncovered.",
