Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature (about 70 degrees) at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Use immediately or store in refrigerator for up to 3 days (allow to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before proceeding with recipe)."

        "stepNumber": 3,
        "instruction": "Sprinkle 2 teaspoons salt over dough; stir into dough until thoroughly incorporated, about 1 minute. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 30 minutes. Spray rubber spatula or bowl scraper with vegetable oil spray; fold partially risen dough over itself by gently lifting and folding the edge of the dough toward the middle. Turn bowl 90 degrees; fold again. Turn bowl and fold dough 6 more times (total of 8 turns). Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes. Repeat folding, turning, and rising 2 more times, for a total of three 30-minute rises. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position, place baking stone on the rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees, at least 30 minutes before baking."

        "stepNumber": 4,
        "instruction": "Gently transfer dough to lightly floured work surface. Lightly dust top of dough with flour and divide it in half. Shape each piece of dough into 5-inch round by gently tucking under edges. Coat two 9-inch round cake pans with 2 tablespoons olive oil each. Sprinkle each pan with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Place round of dough in 1 pan, top side down; slide dough around pan to coat bottom and sides, then flip dough over. Repeat with second piece of dough and second pan. Cover pans with plastic wrap and let rest for 5 minutes."

(If dough resists stretching, let it relax for 5 to 10 minutes before trying to stretch it again.) Using dinner fork, poke entire surface of dough 25 to 30 times, popping any large bubbles. Sprinkle rosemary evenly over top of dough. Let dough rest in pan until slightly bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes."

        "stepNumber": 6,
        "instruction": "Place pans on baking stone and lower oven temperature to 450 degrees. Bake until tops are golden brown, 25 to 28 minutes, switching placement of pans halfway through baking time. Transfer pans to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove loaves from pans and place on wire rack. Brush tops with any oil remaining in pans. Let cool for 30 minutes before serving. Focaccia can be wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap and stored room temperature or frozen for up to 2 months."
