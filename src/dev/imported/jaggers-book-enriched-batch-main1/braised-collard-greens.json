Repeat with remaining collards. Transfer ribbons to large bowl and cover with cool water. Swish with your hand to dislodge grit. Repeat with fresh water, as needed, until grit no longer appears in bottom of bowl. Remove collards from water and set aside."

Cover and continue to boil, turning ham hocks and stirring halfway through cooking, until collards are very tender, about 11/2 hours. (If liquid is more than 2 inches deep at this point, continue to cook, uncovered, until liquid has reduced to about 1 inch, about 30 minutes longer. If liquid is less than 1 inch deep, add enough water to measure 1 inch.)"
