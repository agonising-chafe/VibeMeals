Coat the inside of the bowl with vegetable oil spray, and place the bowl in a roasting pan. Gently mound and pack the stuffing into the foil bowl and position the chicken over the stuffing. Roast the chicken until just beginning to brown, about 30 minutes. Rotate the pan and continue to roast until the skin is crisped and deep golden brown, the thickest part of the breasts registers 160 degrees, and the thickest part of the thighs registers 175 degrees, 25 to 35 minutes longer. Transfer the chicken to a carving board and let rest for 10 minutes."
