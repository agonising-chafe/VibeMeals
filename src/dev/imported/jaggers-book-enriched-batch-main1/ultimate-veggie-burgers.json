Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until lentils are just beginning to fall apart, about 25 minutes. Drain lentils, spread out over paper towel–lined rimmed baking sheet, and pat dry; let cool to room temperature."

      {
        "stepNumber": 3,
        "instruction": "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions, celery, leek, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Spread vegetable mixture onto second rimmed baking sheet."

        "instruction": "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 12 minutes; add to baking sheet with other vegetables and let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes."

        "instruction": "Pulse cashews in food processor until finely chopped, about 15 pulses. Stir cashews into bulgur, then stir in cooled lentils, vegetable-mushroom mixture, and mayonnaise. Working in 2 batches, pulse mixture in now-empty food processor until coarsely chopped, 15 to 20 pulses (mixture should be cohesive but roughly textured); transfer to clean bowl."

(Patties can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month.) To freeze, transfer patties to 2 parchment paper–lined rimmed baking sheets and freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Stack patties, separated by parchment paper; wrap in plastic."

        "stepNumber": 7,
        "instruction": "TO COOK BURGERS: Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place 4 patties in skillet and cook until well browned on first side, about 4 minutes. Using 2 spatulas, gently flip patties and continue to cook until well browned on second side, about 4 minutes, adding extra oil as needed if skillet looks dry. Transfer burgers to platter, wipe skillet clean with paper towels, and repeat with extra oil and remaining patties as desired. (If patties were previously frozen, transfer to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and bake in 350-degree oven until heated through, about 10 minutes.) Serve burgers on buns."
