Whisk the eggs, mustard, 1 teaspoon of the orange zest, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in another shallow dish. Working with 1 chicken breast at a time, dip the chicken into the egg mixture, turning to coat well and allowing the excess to drip off, then coat with the nut mixture, pressing gently so that the nuts adhere. Place the breaded chicken in a single layer on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and let sit for 5 minutes."

Add 2 of the chicken breasts and cook until browned on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes total. Drain the chicken briefly on a paper towel–lined plate, then transfer to a clean wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Discard the oil and wipe out the skillet with paper towels. Repeat with 6 tablespoons more oil and the remaining chicken. Discard the oil and wipe out the skillet with paper towels."

Add the orange slices and cook until lightly browned around the edges, 11/2 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, the shallot, remaining 1/4 teaspoon zest, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and allow residual heat to soften the shallot, about 30 seconds. Pour the warm dressing with the oranges over the spinach and toss gently. Divide the greens among individual plates. Remove the chicken from the oven, set a cutlet over each portion, and serve."
