Continue to cook, stirring and shaking skillet frequently, until beef is coated and browned and center is just pink (to check for doneness, remove larger piece and cut in half), 2 to 4 minutes longer.

Add reserved marinade and bring to boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened and glossy, about 2 minutes. Add beef and any accumulated juices and toss to coat. Scatter beef mixture and sauce over watercress. Drizzle 2 teaspoons lime juice mixture over salad. Divide remaining lime juice mixture among small bowls for dipping and serve with salad."
