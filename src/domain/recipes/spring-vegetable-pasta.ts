Add the asparagus spears and cook until the asparagus is crisp-tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the remaining garlic and the red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the remaining 1 cup peas and continue to cook for 1 minute longer. Transfer the vegetables to a plate and set aside. Wipe out the pot."

Off the heat, stir in half of the herb mixture, the vegetables, lemon juice, and 1/2 cup of the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately, passing the additional Parmesan and the remaining herb mixture separately."
