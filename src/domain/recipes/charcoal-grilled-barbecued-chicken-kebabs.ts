Place kebabs over coals and cook, turning one-quarter turn every 2 to 21/2 minutes until well browned and slightly charred, 8 minutes for breasts or 10 minutes for thighs. (If flare-ups occur, slide kebabs to cool side of grill until fire dies down.) Brush top surface of kebabs with 1/4 cup sauce; flip and cook until sauce is brown in spots, about 1 minute. Brush second side with remaining 1/4 cup sauce; flip and continue to cook until brown in spots and breasts register 160 degrees or thighs register 175 degrees, about 1 minute. Remove kebabs from grill and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve, passing reserved barbecue sauce separately."
