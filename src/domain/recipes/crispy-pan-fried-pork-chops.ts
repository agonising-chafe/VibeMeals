Using tongs, coat with buttermilk mixture; let excess drip off. Coat with cornflake mixture; gently pat off excess.

Carefully flip chops and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, crispy, and chops register 145 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 2 to 5 minutes longer. Transfer chops to paper towel–lined plate and let drain for 30 seconds on each side. Transfer to clean wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet, then transfer to oven to keep warm. Discard oil in skillet and wipe clean with paper towels. Repeat process with remaining 1/3 cup oil and 4 pork chops. Serve with lemon wedges."
