Gently crumple and uncrumple two 24-inch lengths of aluminum foil. Place 1 piece in 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet and second piece on large serving platter; cover foil on platter with dish towel for presentation, if desired. Nestle oysters, cupped side down, into foil on prepared sheet and bake until oysters open slightly, about 5 minutes. (It’s OK to eat oysters that don’t open.) Let oysters rest until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes."

Serve, passing lemon wedges separately."
