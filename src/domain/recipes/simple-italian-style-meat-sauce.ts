Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, and red pepper flakes; cook until fragrant and the tomato paste starts to brown, about 1 minute. Add the 1/4 cup reserved tomato juice and the oregano scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen the browned bits. Add the meat mixture and cook, breaking the meat into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 2 to 4 minutes, making sure that the meat does not brown."

Stir in the cheese and the remaining 1 teaspoon fresh oregano; season with salt and pepper to taste.
