Pour mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl, pressing with back of spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Return liquid to saucepan and simmer over medium-high heat until reduced to 1/3 cup, about 5 minutes; reserve for glazing. Pulse apple mixture in food processor until coarsely chopped, about 15 pulses. Transfer filling to bowl and refrigerate until needed."

Cut through thicker half of roast about 1/2 inch from bottom, stopping about 1/2 inch before edge. Open up this flap. Repeat until pork is even 1/2-inch thickness throughout.
