Working with 1 chop at a time, and starting at 1 end of chop, insert paring knife at 45-degree angle through fat cap to create 1/4-inch slit, pushing knife through until you reach cutting board (do not cut from edge to edge). Repeat around perimeter of fat cap, spacing slits 3/4 inch apart."

Use your hand to dip 1 chop in egg and allow excess to drip back into bowl to ensure very thin coating. Place chop on top of panko and, using your other hand, cover pork with crumbs, pressing firmly so crumbs stick to all sides. Return to cutting board. Repeat with remaining chops, tilting dish to rearrange panko on 1 side before coating."

Place chops in skillet and cook, using tongs to lift 1 edge of each chop occasionally to allow steam to escape, until deep golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chops to prepared rack, leaning them against loaf pan. Let rest for 5 minutes."
