Whisk in beer until almost smooth (small lumps are OK). Add one-quarter of rings to batter and stir to coat. Using your fingers or tongs, transfer rings to oil one at a time until surface of oil is covered. Fry rings, turning occasionally and adjusting heat to keep oil temperature between 360 and 375, until deep golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Transfer rings to prepared rack and place in oven. Return oil to 380 degrees and repeat with remaining onion rings and batter. Serve with sauce."
