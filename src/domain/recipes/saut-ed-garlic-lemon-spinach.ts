Using the tongs, transfer the spinach to a colander set in a sink and gently squeeze the spinach with the tongs to release the excess liquid. Return the spinach to the Dutch oven; sprinkle with the lemon juice and stir to coat. Drizzle with the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil and season with salt to taste. Serve."
