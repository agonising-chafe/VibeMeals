          instruction: "FOR THE CHICKEN: Place the chicken, breast side down, on a work surface. Use the tip of a sharp knife to make four 1-inch incisions along the back of the chicken. Using your fingers or the handle of a wooden spoon, separate the skin from the thighs and breast, being careful not to break the skin. Using a metal skewer, poke 15 to 20 holes in the fat deposits on top of the breast halves and thighs. Tuck the wings behind the back."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 2,
          instruction: "Combine the salt, baking powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle evenly all over with the salt mixture. Rub in the mixture with your hands, coating the entire surface evenly. Set the chicken, breast side up, on a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for 30 to 60 minutes. Meanwhile, adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and heat the oven to 325 degrees."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 3,
          instruction: "Open the beer can and pour out (or drink) about half of the liquid. Spray the can lightly with vegetable oil spray and place in the middle of a roasting pan. Slide the chicken over the can so the drumsticks reach down to the bottom of the can, the chicken stands upright, and the breast is perpendicular to the bottom of the pan. Roast until the skin starts to turn golden and the thickest part of the breasts registers 140 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 75 to 90 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken and pan from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees"
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 4,
          instruction: "FOR THE GLAZE: While the chicken cooks, stir the water and cornstarch together in a small bowl until no lumps remain; set aside. Bring the remaining glaze ingredients to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 3/4 cup, 6 to 8 minutes. Slowly whisk the cornstarch mixture into the glaze. Return to a simmer and cook for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 5,
          instruction: "When the oven is heated to 500 degrees, place 11/2 cups water in the bottom of the roasting pan and return to the oven. Roast until the entire chicken skin is browned and crisp, the thickest part of the breasts registers 160 degrees, and the thickest part of the thighs registers 175 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 24 to 30 minutes. Check the chicken halfway through roasting; if the top is becoming too dark, place a 7-inch square piece of foil over the neck and wingtips of the chicken and continue to roast (if the pan begins to smoke and sizzle, add 1/2 cup water to the roasting pan)."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 6,
          instruction: "Brush the chicken with 1/4 cup of the glaze and continue to roast until browned and sticky, about 5 minutes. (If the glaze has become stiff, return to low heat to soften.) Carefully remove the chicken from the oven, transfer the chicken, still on the can, to a carving board, and brush with 1/4 cup more glaze. Let rest for 20 minutes."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 7,
          instruction: "While the chicken rests, strain the juices from the pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a fat separator; allow the liquid to settle for 5 minutes. Whisk 1/2 cup juices into the remaining 1/4 cup glaze in a saucepan and set over low heat. Using a dish towel, carefully lift the chicken off the can and onto a platter or carving board. Carve the chicken, adding any accumulated juices to the sauce. Serve, passing the sauce separately."
