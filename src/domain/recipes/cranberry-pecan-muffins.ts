Using a rubber spatula, fold the cranberries into the batter. Using an ice cream scoop or large spoon, divide the batter equally among the prepared muffin cups (the batter should completely fill the cups and mound slightly). Evenly sprinkle the streusel topping over the muffins, gently pressing into the batter to adhere. Bake until the muffin tops are golden and just firm, 17 to 18 minutes, rotating the muffin tin halfway through baking. Cool the muffins in the muffin tin on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove the muffins from the tin and cool for 10 minutes before serving."
