Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate, leaving fat in saucepan (you should have 2 tablespoons bacon fat; if not, add oil to make this amount). Whisk in flour and cook over medium-low heat until golden, about 5 minutes. Whisk in broth and bring to boil, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat; cover and set aside off heat."

Use sharp knife to cut two slits, about 2 inches apart, through outer layer of fat and silver skin of each chop (do not cut into meat of chops). Sprinkle each chop with 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Brown chops in single layer until browned on first side, about 3 minutes. Flip chops and cook until second side is browned, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer chops to plate and set aside."

Return chops to skillet and cover with onions. Add reserved sauce, bay leaves, and any accumulated meat juices from plate to skillet. Cover and simmer over low heat until chops are tender and paring knife inserted into chops meets little resistance, about 30 minutes."
