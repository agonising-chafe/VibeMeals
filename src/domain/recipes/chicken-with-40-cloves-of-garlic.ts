Sprinkle both sides of chicken pieces with 1/2 teaspoon pepper."

Uncover, stir, and continue to roast, uncovered, until browned and fully tender, about 10 minutes longer, stirring once or twice. Remove from oven and increase oven temperature to 450 degrees."

Brown chicken, skin side down, until golden, about 5 minutes; flip chicken pieces and brown until golden on second side, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to large plate and pour off fat from skillet. Off heat, add vermouth, chicken broth, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf to pan, scraping up any browned bits. Set skillet over medium heat, add garlic mixture, and return chicken, skin side up, to pan, nestling pieces on top of and between garlic cloves. Place skillet in oven and roast until the thickest part of breasts registers 160 degrees; remove skillet from oven."

Transfer 10 to 12 garlic cloves to fine-mesh sieve and reserve. Using slotted spoon, scatter remaining garlic cloves and shallots around chicken; discard herbs. Using rubber spatula, push reserved garlic cloves through sieve and into bowl; discard skins. Add garlic paste to skillet and bring liquid to simmer over medium-high heat, whisking to incorporate garlic. Whisk in butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve chicken, passing sauce separately."
