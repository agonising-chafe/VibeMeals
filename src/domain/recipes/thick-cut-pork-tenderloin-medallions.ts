Turn pork and brown on second side, 3 to 5 minutes more. Reduce heat to medium. Using tongs, stand each piece on its side and cook, turning pieces as necessary, until sides are well browned and internal temperature registers 140 to 145 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer pork to platter, tent loosely with foil, and let rest until temperature registers 150 degrees on instant-read thermometer, while making pan sauce. Serve with sauce."
