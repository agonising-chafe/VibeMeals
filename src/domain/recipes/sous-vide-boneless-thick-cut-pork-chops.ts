Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place 2 chops in skillet and cook until well browned on first side, 1 to 2 minutes, lifting halfway through cooking to redistribute fat underneath each chop. Flip chops and continue to cook until well browned on second side, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer chops to plate and tent with aluminum foil. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and remaining chops. Serve, passing relish separately."
