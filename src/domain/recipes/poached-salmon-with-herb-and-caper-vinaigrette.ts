Set pan over high heat and bring liquid to simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook fillets register 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 11 to 16 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine remaining shallot, minced herbs, capers, olive oil, and honey in medium bowl. Strain reduced cooking liquid through fine-mesh strainer into bowl with herb-caper mixture, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Whisk to combine and season with salt and pepper to taste."
