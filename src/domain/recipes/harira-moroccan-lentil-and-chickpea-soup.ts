          displayName: "WHY THIS RECIPES WORKS A popular Moroccan soup, harira features a hearty mix of legumes flavored with warm spices and fresh herbs. Like countless other regional dishes, harira’s exact ingredients vary from region to region and even from family to family. For our version, we carefully reduced the ingredient list and altered the technique to deliver harira’s flavors in less time. We decided to omit the meat (lamb, chicken, or beef is common) in this soup—with all the other robust flavors and textures in the mix, the meat wasn’t missed. To save time, we opted for convenient canned chickpeas rather than dried beans, plus quick-cooking lentils. We pared down the number of spices to a key five available in most supermarkets. For more depth of flavor, we also replaced half the water with chicken broth. Using large amounts of just two herbs made for quicker prep and a more efficient use of fresh ingredients. Finishing the dish with fresh lemon juice helped focus all the flavors. This wonderfully complex-tasting, spice-filled soup, made almost entirely from pantry ingredients, brought humble lentils to a whole other level. For a vegetarian version, substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth and water. We like to garnish this soup with a small amount of harissa, a fiery North African chili paste.",
