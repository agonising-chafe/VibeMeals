          instruction: "Puree half of the tomatoes in a food processor until smooth. Dice the remaining tomatoes into 1/2-inch pieces, discarding the cores. Combine the pureed and diced tomatoes in a liquid measuring cup (you should have about 12/3 cups). Add the reserved juice to equal 2 cups."

          stepNumber: 2,
          instruction: "Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is light golden around the edges, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds."

          stepNumber: 3,
          instruction: "Stir in the tomatoes and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Remove the pan from the heat and add the vodka. Return the pan to medium-high heat and simmer briskly until the alcohol flavor is cooked off, 8 to 10 minutes; stir frequently and lower the heat to medium if the simmering becomes too vigorous. Stir in the cream and cook until hot, about 1 minute."

    {
          stepNumber: 4,
          instruction: "Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to a boil in a large pot. Add 1 tablespoon salt and the pasta to the boiling water. Cook, stirring often, until just shy of al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water then drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Add the sauce to the pasta and toss over medium heat until the pasta absorbs some of the sauce, 1 to 2 minutes. Adjust the consistency of the sauce with the reserved pasta cooking water as needed. Stir in the basil and season with salt to taste. Serve immediately, passing the Parmesan separately."
