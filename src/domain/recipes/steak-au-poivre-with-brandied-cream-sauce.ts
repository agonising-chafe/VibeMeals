Press on the steaks with the bottom of a cake pan and cook until well-browned on the first side, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip the steaks over and continue to cook, pressing again with the cake pan, until the center of the steaks registers 115 to 120 degrees (for rare) about 3 minutes, 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare about 4 minutes, or 130 to 135 degrees (for medium) about 5 minutes). Transfer the steaks to a plate, tent loosely with foil, and let rest while making the sauce."

Add the broth mixture, 1/4 cup of the brandy, and the cream to the skillet and bring to a boil over high heat, scraping up any browned bits. Simmer until golden brown and thickened, about 5 minutes. Off the heat, whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, the remaining 1 tablespoon brandy, the lemon juice, and any accumulated meat juices from the plate; season with salt to taste. Spoon the sauce over the steaks and serve immediately."
