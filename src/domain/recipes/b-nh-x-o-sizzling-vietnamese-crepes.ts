Transfer to medium bowl and add hot water and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Stir in fish sauce and lime juice. Divide sauce among 4 individual small serving bowls."

Arrange lettuce, basil, and cilantro on serving platter. Whisk hot water, rice flour, cornstarch, turmeric, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in bowl until smooth."

Add pork and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is no longer pink and onion is softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add shrimp and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp just begin to turn pink, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer mixture to second bowl. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels. Add coconut milk and 2 teaspoons oil to crepe batter and stir to combine."

Spread pork mixture over half of skillet. Pour 1/2 cup batter evenly over entire skillet. (Batter poured over filling will drain to skillet surface. If needed, tilt skillet gently to fill gaps.) Spread 1 cup bean sprouts over filling. Cook until crepe loosens completely from bottom of skillet with gentle shake, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, shaking skillet occasionally, until edges of crepe are lacy and crisp and underside is golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes longer."
