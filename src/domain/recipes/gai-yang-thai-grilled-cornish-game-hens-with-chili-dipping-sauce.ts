Tuck wingtips behind backs and turn legs so drumsticks face inward toward breasts. Place hens, skin side up, on cooler side of grill (if using charcoal, arrange hens so that legs and thighs are facing coals). Cover and cook until skin has browned and breasts register 145 to 150 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating hens halfway through cooking."
