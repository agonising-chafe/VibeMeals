Peel stem and base with paring or bird’s beak knife to remove dark-green layer. Starting halfway up leaves, use chef’s knife to make 45-degree angled cut toward top of artichoke to remove tips of leaves. Repeat same cut 3 more times, rotating artichoke quarter turn before each cut."

Cook until paring knife slipped into thickest part of base meets little resistance and leaves are medium brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer artichokes to prepared rack cut side down to drain. Remove saucepan from heat. Let artichokes cool for 15 minutes. (Artichoke halves can be wrapped well and refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)"

Cook until outer leaves are dark brown, 45 to 60 seconds. Transfer to prepared rack cut side down to drain. Return oil to 350 degrees and repeat with remaining artichoke halves in 3 batches. Sprinkle artichokes on both sides with flake sea salt to taste. Serve, passing lemon wedges separately."
