Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and set aside. In a second small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, molasses, soy sauce, fish sauce, and 11/4 teaspoons salt. Whisk the eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl."

          stepNumber: 2,
          instruction: "Thinly slice the remaining 3 shallots and place in a 12-inch nonstick skillet with the oil. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the shallots are golden and crisp, 6 to 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shallots to a paper towel–lined plate and season with salt to taste. Pour off the oil and reserve. Wipe out the skillet with paper towels."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 3,
          instruction: "Heat 1 teaspoon of the reserved oil in the now-empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add half of the eggs to the skillet, gently tilting the pan to evenly coat the bottom. Cover and cook until the bottom of the omelet is spotty golden brown and the top is just set, about 11/2 minutes. Slide the omelet onto a cutting board and gently roll up into a tight log. Using a sharp knife, cut the log crosswise into 1-inch segments (leaving the segments rolled). Repeat with 1 teaspoon more reserved oil and the remaining egg."

    {
          stepNumber: 4,
          instruction: "Remove the rice from the refrigerator and break up any large clumps with your fingers. Heat 3 tablespoons more reserved oil in the now-empty skillet over medium heat until just shimmering. Add the chile mixture and cook until the mixture turns golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the shrimp, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring constantly, until the exterior of the shrimp is just opaque, about 2 minutes. Push the shrimp to the sides of the skillet to clear the center; stir the molasses mixture to recombine and pour into the center of the skillet. When the molasses mixture bubbles, add the rice and cook, stirring and folding constantly, until the shrimp is cooked, the rice is heated through, and the mixture is evenly coated, about 3 minutes. Stir in the scallions, remove from the heat, and transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with the egg segments, fried shallots, and lime wedges; serve immediately."
