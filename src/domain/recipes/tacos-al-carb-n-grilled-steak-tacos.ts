Cook steak, flipping every 2 minutes, until meat is well browned and registers 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 7 to 12 minutes. Cook jalapeños until skins are blistered and charred in spots, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer steak to clean cutting board and tent with aluminum foil. Transfer jalapeños to medium bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap."

Transfer to bowl with jalapeños and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Arrange half of tortillas over hotter side of grill and cook until lightly charred, about 45 to 60 seconds per side. Tightly wrap warmed tortillas in foil. Repeat with remaining tortillas."

Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons oil, lime juice, remaining adobo sauce, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Season with lime juice, salt, and jalapeño seeds to taste. Slice steak thin across grain and transfer to serving platter. Serve, passing scallion salsa, tortillas, lime wedges, cilantro, and sour cream separately."
