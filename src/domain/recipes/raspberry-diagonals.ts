          stepNumber: 2,
          instruction: "Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Stop mixer. Add flour and mix on low speed until mixture comes together in crumbly dough, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl halfway through mixing. Transfer to work surface and knead gently until dough forms smooth ball."

          instruction: "Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Gently roll and pinch each piece into 14-inch log (if dough cracks, pinch it back together). Arrange logs lengthwise on prepared sheet. Press your index finger along length of 1 log to create trough that is 3/4 inch wide and 1/4 inch to 1/3 inch deep, using fingers of your other hand to mold sides. Repeat with remaining logs."

Bake until logs are lightly browned and firm to touch, about 30 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Cool on sheet until just warm to touch."

(If mixture is too thick to drizzle, whisk in more water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time.) Using spoon, drizzle icing over cookies. Let sit until icing is set, 25 to 30 minutes."

Using sharp chef’s knife at 45-degree angle, trim 1/2 inch from each end of log and discard trim. Slice remaining length on diagonal into 8 pieces. Repeat with remaining logs. Serve. (Store cookies at room temperature for up to 6 days.)"
