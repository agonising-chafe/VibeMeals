Remove chops from brine; thoroughly pat dry with paper towels.

Place chops in skillet; cook until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes, using spoon or spatula to press down on center of chops to aid in browning. Using tongs, flip chops and brown lightly on second side, about 1 minute. Transfer chops to large plate; set aside."

Add water and 1/2 cup of vinegar and bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits with wooden spoon. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until liquid is reduced to about 1/3 cup, 6 to 8 minutes.

Add any accumulated juices to skillet; set skillet in oven and cook until center of chops registers 140 to 145 degrees, 8 to 12 minutes (begin checking temperature after 6 minutes). Using potholders, carefully remove skillet from oven (handle will be very hot) and cover skillet with lid or foil; let stand until center of chops registers 150 degrees, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chops to platter or individual plates. Swirl butter into sauce and peppers in skillet; taste and stir in remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar (if using) and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then pour or spoon sauce and peppers over chops. Serve immediately."
