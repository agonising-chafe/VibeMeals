Brush with 1 tablespoon of strained oil and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Microwave until potatoes offer slight resistance when pierced with paring knife, about 8 minutes, turning halfway through microwaving. Transfer potatoes to baking sheet coated with 1 tablespoon strained oil. Brush with remaining 1 tablespoon strained oil and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper."
