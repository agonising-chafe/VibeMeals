(If any dough sticks to your fingers, add up to 1/4 cup extra flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Process until flour is fully incorporated after each addition, 10 to 15 seconds, before retesting. If dough doesn’t become cohesive, add up to 1 tablespoon water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until it just comes together; process 30 seconds longer.)"

Add pork and pulse until mixture is well combined, about 5 pulses. Transfer filling to medium bowl, cover with plastic, and refrigerate until needed."

Using heavy rolling pin, roll into 6-inch square."

Return rolling pin to center of dough and roll toward you in 1 motion. Repeat rolling steps until dough sticks to counter and measures roughly 12 inches long. Lightly dust both sides of dough with flour and continue to roll out dough until it measures roughly 20 inches long and 6 inches wide, frequently lifting dough to release it from counter. (If dough firmly sticks to counter and wrinkles when rolled out, carefully lift dough and dust counter lightly with flour.) Transfer dough sheet to prepared baking sheet and cover with plastic. Repeat rolling process with remaining 5 dough squares and transfer to prepared sheet (2 dough sheets per layer; place parchment between layers). Keep dough covered with plastic."

Starting 11/2 inches from left edge of dough and 1 inch from bottom, deposit 1 tablespoon filling. Repeat placing 1-tablespoon mounds of filling, spaced 11/2 inches apart, 1 inch from bottom edge of dough. You should be able to fit 6 mounds of filling on 1 dough sheet."

Working with 1 piece at a time, lift top edge of dough over filling and extend it so that it lines up with bottom edge. Keeping top edge of dough suspended over filling with your thumbs, use your fingers to press dough layers together, working around each mound of filling from back to front, pressing out as much air as possible before sealing completely."

Transfer ravioli to prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate until ready to cook. Repeat shaping process with remaining dough and remaining filling. (Dough scraps can be frozen and added to soup.)"

          instruction: "Bring 6 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add ravioli and 1 tablespoon salt. Cook, maintaining gentle boil, until ravioli are just tender, about 13 minutes. (To test, pull 1 ravioli from pot, trim off corner without cutting into filling, and taste. Return ravioli to pot if not yet tender.) Drain well. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer ravioli to warmed bowls or plates. Serve immediately, passing extra Parmesan separately. (Freeze uncooked ravioli in single layer on parchment paper–lined rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 1 month. Cook frozen ravioli with no change to cooking time.)"
