          stepNumber: 4,

          stepNumber: 5,
          instruction: "Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Press dough to expel air, then transfer dough to counter. Pat into 8-inch square of even thickness. Using bench scraper or chef’s knife, cut dough into 16 equal pieces (4 rows by 4 rows). Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, form dough into smooth, taut balls. (To round, set piece of dough on unfloured counter. Loosely cup your lightly floured hand around dough and, without applying pressure to dough, move your hand in small circular motions. Tackiness of dough against counter and circular motion should work dough into smooth ball.) Arrange dough balls seam side down on prepared sheet, placing 5 balls down each long side and 6 down center. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour."

Bake until rolls are risen and register 170 to 175 degrees, 14 to 16 minutes (rolls will have little to no color). Transfer sheet to wire rack and let cool completely, 30 to 45 minutes (rolls will wrinkle slightly). Transfer sheet to freezer and freeze rolls until solid, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer rolls to zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 6 weeks."

Arrange desired number of frozen rolls on parchment-lined baking sheet and bake until deep golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer rolls to wire rack and let cool for at least 5 minutes before serving."
