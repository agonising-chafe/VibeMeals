          displayName: "WHY THIS RECIPES WORKS Canned cream of tomato soup is a childhood favorite. We wanted a version for grown-ups, a well-balanced cream of tomato soup, one with rich color, great tomato flavor, and a silky texture. Right away, we turned to canned tomatoes; fresh tomatoes are at their best just a few months out of the year and we didn’t want to restrict our soup-making to just one season. To coax the most flavor from our canned whole tomatoes, we roasted them. The intense dry heat concentrated the flavor, and a sprinkling of brown sugar encouraged caramelization. We cooked our roasted tomatoes with shallots, chicken broth, and reserved tomato juice to develop robust flavor, then pureed the tomatoes (with broth) to keep the deep flavor of the tomato broth intact. Finished with heavy cream and a splash of brandy, this soup will satisfy everyone at the table. Make sure to use canned whole tomatoes that are not packed in puree; you will need some of the juice to make the soup.",
