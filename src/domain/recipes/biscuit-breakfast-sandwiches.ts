    {
          stepNumber: 1,
          instruction: "FOR THE BISCUITS: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Generously grease 8-inch square baking pan. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in bowl."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 2,
          instruction: "Add melted butter to buttermilk and stir until small clumps form. Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture and stir well until fully combined. Transfer dough to prepared pan. Using your lightly greased hands, pat dough into even layer and into corners of pan (dough will be thin). Using bench scraper sprayed with vegetable oil spray, cut dough in half. Turn pan 90 degrees and make 2 equidistant parallel cuts to create 6 rectangles. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let biscuits cool in pan for 5 minutes. Transfer biscuits to wire rack. Turn off oven."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 3,
          instruction: "FOR THE FILLINGS: While biscuits bake, line half of large plate with paper towels. Slice 1 sausage lengthwise, stopping just short of slicing all the way through. Open sausage up like book; invert onto cold 12-inch nonstick skillet; press to flatten into rectangle; and remove casing, if desired. Repeat with remaining sausages. Cook over medium-high heat until firm to touch, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer sausages to paper towel–lined side of prepared plate. Wipe out skillet with paper towels."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 4,
          instruction: "Beat 3 eggs with 1/8 teaspoon salt until whites and yolks are thoroughly combined. Melt 1 teaspoon butter in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat. Swirl butter over surface of pan. Add eggs and tilt pan to evenly coat bottom. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook for 45 seconds. Uncover and tilt to swirl uncooked egg to edges of omelet. Cover and continue to cook until top is just set, 45 to 60 seconds. Slide skillet off heat. Run spatula around edges to loosen."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 5,
          instruction: "Fold 4 sides of egg toward middle to create 8-inch square. Fold square in half to create 8 by 4-inch rectangle. Use edge of spatula to cut rectangle crosswise into 3 rectangles. Transfer to unlined side of plate. Repeat with remaining 3 eggs, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon butter. After cooking and portioning second batch of eggs, return first batch of eggs and all sausages to skillet. Cover to keep warm."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 6,
          instruction: "Separate biscuits into 6 portions. Stand 1 biscuit on side and gently saw in half with serrated knife. Repeat with remaining biscuits. Arrange biscuit bottoms on now-empty plate and top each with 1/2 slice cheese, 1 egg portion, 1 sausage, and remaining 1/2 slice cheese. Arrange biscuit tops over cheese. Place sandwiches in still-warm oven until cheese is melted, at least 5 minutes or up to 20 minutes. Serve (plate will be hot). (Refrigerate leftover sandwiches for up to 3 days. To reheat, place sandwich on plate and cover with bowl. Microwave for 1 minute. Uncover and let sit for 1 minute before serving. Crusts of reheated biscuits will be softer.)"
