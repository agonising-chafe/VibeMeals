Spread 1/4 cup tamale dough into 4-inch square over bottom right-hand corner, pushing it flush to bottom edge but leaving 11/2-inch border at wide edge. Mound scant 2 tablespoons filling in line across center of dough, parallel to bottom edge. Roll husk away from you and over filling, so that dough surrounds filling and forms cylinder. Fold up tapered end, leaving top open, and transfer seam side down to platter."

Cover and steam, checking water level often and adding additional water as needed, until tamales easily come free from husks, about 1 hour. Transfer tamales to large platter. Reheat remaining sauce from filling in covered bowl in microwave, about 30 seconds, and serve with tamales."
