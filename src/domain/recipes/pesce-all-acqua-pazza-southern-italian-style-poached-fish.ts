Add tomatoes and cook, stirring constantly, until they begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in water, wine, parsley stems and half of chopped parsley and bring to boil. Nestle fillets skin side down in liquid, moving aside solids as much as possible (it’s fine if fillets fold over slightly at ends; liquid will not quite cover fillets). Spoon some liquid and solids over fillets. Adjust heat to low, cover, and simmer gently until fillets register 110 at thickest point, 4 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and let stand, covered, until fish is opaque and just cooked through (fish should register at least 135 degrees), 3 to 7 minutes."
