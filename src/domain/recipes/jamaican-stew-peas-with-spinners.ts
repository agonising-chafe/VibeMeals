Lower heat to maintain vigorous simmer. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until beans start to soften and liquid is slightly reduced, about 11/2 hours. Stir in coconut milk and continue to cook until beans are completely soft (it’s OK if some skins crack) and sauce thickens, about 30 minutes longer."

Knead in bowl until dough clears sides of bowl and forms tight ball (if dough seems too dry to shape, add up to 2 teaspoons water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time). Pinch off about 1 teaspoon dough and roll between your palms to form 3-inch-long dumpling with tapered ends. Transfer to plate and repeat with remaining dough (you should have 14 to 16 dumplings)."

          stepNumber: 5,
          instruction: "Taste stew; adjust spiciness, if desired, by pressing cheesecloth bundle against side of pot with back of spoon to release juice of Scotch bonnet. Discard bundle and transfer ham hocks to plate to cool slightly. Gently drop dumplings into stew. Simmer, without stirring, until dumplings are set, about 5 minutes. While dumplings cook, debone ham hocks and cut meat into 1/2-inch pieces (you’ll have 1/2 to 2/3 cup meat); discard bones, skin, and fat. Stir meat, scallions, and chopped thyme into stew. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer until flavors have melded and scallions have softened slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve."
