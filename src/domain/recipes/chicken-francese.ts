Cut each chicken breast in half crosswise, then cut thick half in half again horizontally, creating 3 cutlets of similar thickness.

Slice remaining (unzested) lemon half into four 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Discard end. Cut 3 tablespoons butter into 1/2-inch cubes and transfer to small bowl. Sprinkle cubes with 1 teaspoon flour and toss until cubes are fully coated and no loose flour remains in bowl; refrigerate until needed."
