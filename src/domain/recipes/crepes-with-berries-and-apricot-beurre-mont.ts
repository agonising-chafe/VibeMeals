          instruction: "FOR THE CREPES: Place oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet and heat over low heat for at least 10 minutes. While skillet is heating, whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in medium bowl. In separate bowl, whisk together milk and eggs. Add half of milk mixture to dry ingredients and whisk until smooth. Whisk in melted butter. Whisk in remaining milk mixture until smooth."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 2,
          instruction: "Using paper towel, wipe out skillet, leaving thin film of oil on bottom and sides. Increase heat to medium and let skillet heat for 1 minute. After 1 minute, test heat of skillet by placing 1 teaspoon batter in center and cook for 20 seconds. If mini crepe is golden brown on bottom, skillet is properly heated. If it is too light or too dark, adjust heat accordingly and retest."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 3,
          instruction: "Pour 1/4 cup batter into pan and tilt and shake gently until batter evenly covers bottom of pan. Cook crepe without moving it until top surface is dry and crepe starts to brown at edges, loosening crepe from side of pan with rubber spatula, about 25 seconds. Gently slide spatula underneath edge of crepe, grasp edge with your fingertips, and flip crêpe. Cook until second side is lightly spotted, about 20 seconds. Transfer cooked crepe to wire rack. Return pan to heat and heat for 10 seconds before repeating with remaining batter. As crepes are done, stack on wire rack. (Crepes can be covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days.)"

    {
          stepNumber: 4,
          instruction: "FOR THE BEURRE MONTÉ: Bring water to simmer in small saucepan over medium-high heat; reduce heat to maintain very gentle simmer. Add 1 piece butter and cook, whisking constantly, until butter is melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Continue to cook, whisking in butter 1 piece at a time until all butter is incorporated and sauce has consistency of thin gravy, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in preserves, schnapps, lemon juice, and salt. Reduce heat to lowest possible setting and cover to keep warm."

          stepNumber: 5,
          instruction: "TO SERVE: Transfer crepes to large plate and cover with second plate. Microwave until crepes are warm, 30 to 45 seconds. Arrange crepes on serving plates. Scatter berries over crepes. Whisk sauce vigorously to blend in any butterfat that has collected on surface. Spoon sauce over crepes and serve immediately."
