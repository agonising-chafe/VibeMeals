Reduce the speed to medium and beat in one-third of the flour mixture until incorporated; beat in 1/2 cup of the milk. Beat in half of the remaining flour mixture, then the remaining 1/2 cup milk, and finally the remaining flour mixture. Toss the blueberries in a small bowl with the remaining 1 teaspoon flour. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the blueberries. Spread the batter into the prepared pan."

Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then turn out and place on a serving platter (topping side up). Serve warm or at room temperature. The cake can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days."
