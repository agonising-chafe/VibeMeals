Transfer the pulp to the center of a clean dish towel set in a medium bowl. Wrap the towel tightly around the pulp and squeeze until dry. Discard the pulp in the towel and set the corn juice aside (you should have about 2/3 cup of juice)."

Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Whisking constantly, gradually add the water and then bring to a boil. Add the corn kernels and the potatoes.
