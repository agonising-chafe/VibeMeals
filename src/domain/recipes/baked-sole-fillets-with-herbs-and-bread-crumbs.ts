          stepNumber: 2,
          instruction: "Heat 4 tablespoons of the butter in an 8-inch skillet over medium heat until just melted. Add half of the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 3,
          instruction: "Pat the fillets dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper. Arrange the fillets, skinned side up, with the tail end pointing away from you. Spread 1/2 teaspoon mustard on each fillet, sprinkle each evenly with about 1 tablespoon of the herb–lemon zest mixture, and drizzle each with about 11/2 teaspoons of the garlic butter. Tightly roll the fillets from the thick end to form cylinders. Set the fillets, seam side down, in a 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Drizzle the remaining garlic butter over the fillets, cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, and bake for 25 minutes. Wipe out the skillet but do not wash."

          stepNumber: 4,
          instruction: "While the fillets are baking, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the now-empty skillet over medium heat. Add the panko and cook, stirring frequently, until the crumbs are deep golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add the remaining garlic, and cook, stirring constantly, until the garlic is fragrant and evenly distributed in the crumbs, about 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl, stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt, and season with pepper to taste. Let cool, then stir in the reserved 1 tablespoon herb mixture."
        },
    {
          stepNumber: 5,
          instruction: "After the fillets have baked for 25 minutes, remove the baking dish from oven. Baste the fillets with melted garlic butter from the baking dish, sprinkle with all but 3 tablespoons of the bread crumbs, and continue to bake, uncovered, fillets register 135 degrees, 6 to 10 minutes longer. Using a thin metal spatula, transfer the fillets to plates, sprinkle with the remaining bread crumbs, and serve with the lemon wedges."
