Add chicken; cover; and simmer until thickest part of chicken registers 160 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through cooking.

Place warm tortillas on counter and spread 1/3 cup filling down center of each tortilla. Roll each tortilla tightly by hand and place in baking dish, seam side down. Pour remaining tomatillo sauce over top of enchiladas. Use back of a spoon to spread sauce so it coats top of each tortilla.
